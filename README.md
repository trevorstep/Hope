## Time Log

|Date      |Start Time|Category|Description                                 |Total Minutes|
|----------|----------|:------:|--------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
| 1/16/25         | 1:30PM         |    MGT    | Each of us worked on individaul tasks. I said I would start the github repo.  |  60 minutes           |
| 1/16/25       | 5:00PM         |  TP      | I tried to troubleshoot the github but couldnt connect the repo since I had never used github before.| 240 minutes |
|  1/17/25        |  12:00PM        | TP       | I spent 8 hours trying to get the thing to work. I emailed my professor for assistance and it looks like im close. |        480 minutes     |
| 1/21/25         |    1:30PM      |    MGT    |   I got the help I needed to finish the Repo off so the rest of the team could get started in it! We then assigned roles for the next week.  |  60 minutes           |
| 1/23/25         |  2:00 PM       | TP       | We talked about what we wanted to get done for the week.  | 15 minutes            |
|     1/24/25    |  3:28 PM        | IM       | I used the unity asset store to get the tools I needed. I then made a map, a sprite for the player to control and a movement script. As well as some animations.                                     | 840 minutes            |
|1/25/25 |1:30PM | IM |I polished up the movement script since the ridgid body kept on clipping the charchters walking animation. Added a backround, added music, added sound effects when the player is jumping, double jumping and dying. I added a few more platforms to make it actaully fun. I added spikes and a collider in the void beneath the stage so if a player jumped into the spikes or the abys then they would die and respawn at the beginning.| 420 minutes|
